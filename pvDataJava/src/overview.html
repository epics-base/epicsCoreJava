  <dt>pvIOC</dt>
    <dd>A pvIOC is a network accessable smart real time database. The database
      consists of memory resident records. Each record has a name that is
      uniquie within the local area network and contains a top level pvData
      structure. Each field of a record can optionally have support code
      attached to it. The support is called when a request is made to process
      the record. The support code is what makes the record "smart". A pvAccess
      server is provided so that the records can be accesed via the network.
