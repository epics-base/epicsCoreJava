<p>This package contains interfaces and code for standard pvData structure fields.</p>
<p>Only fields named "value" have properties. A record can have multiple value
fields, which can appear in the top level structure of a record or in a
substructure. All other fields in the structure containing a value field are
considered properties of the value field. The fieldname is also the property
name. The value field can have any type, i.e. scalar, scalarArray, or
structure. Typical property fields are timeStamp, alarm, display, control, and
history. The timeStamp is a special case. If it appears anywhere in the
structure hieraracy above a value field it is a property of the value field.</p>
