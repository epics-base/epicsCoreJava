This package implements the interfaces defined in org.epics.pvdata.pv.</p>
<p>It provides everything required for creating pvData. It provides the following
factories:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>FieldFactory</dt>
    <dd>Creates introspection interfaces.</dd>
  <dt>PVDataFactory</dt>
    <dd>Creates data interfaces for all of the supported data types.</dd>
  <dt>ConvertFactory</dt>
    <dd>Converts between support data types.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Although pvDataFactory can provide the implementation for all supported data
types, often it is desirable to provide other implementations. To make it easy
to create alternate implementations a set of abstract and base classes are
supplied.</p>
