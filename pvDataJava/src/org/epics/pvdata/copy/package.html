<p>Create a structure that has a copy of an arbitrary subset of the fields in an existing top level structure.</p>
<p>In addition to specifying a subset of the fields, global and field specific options can be specified.
This code is used by pvAccess clients and servers.
The following are provided:
</p>
<dl>
   <dt>CreateRequest</dt>
     <dd>Given an ascii string that selects the subset of the fields desired and the options, it generates
      a PVStructure that can be passed from a client to a server.
      </dd>
   <dt>PVCopy</dt>
     <dd>
        This is used by a server to pass data between a top level PVStructure that belongs to a client and
       the top level structure that has the server's data.
     </dd>
