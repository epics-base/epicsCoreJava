<h2 style="text-align: center">Overview</h2>
<hr />
<p>Access Security limits access to A PVData database.
Access Security for a PVData database is modeled closely after the EPICS V3
access security as described in the
<a href="http://aps.anl.gov/epics/base/R3-14/11-docs/AppDevGuide.pdf">
V3 Application Developer's Guide.</a>
In that document read chapter "Access Security".
The main difference is that the rules provide for process access in addition
to read and write access.</p>
<p>This document discusses the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Quick start
     <br />A summary of the steps necessary to start access security.</li>
  <li>Userâ€™s Guide
     <br />This explains what access security is and how to use it.</li>
  <li>Design Summary
     <br />Functional Requirements and Design Overview.</li>
  <li>Implementation Overview</li>
  <li>Java IOC Support<br />
     A description of support provided by the javaIOC for access security.</li>
  <li>Channel Access Support<br />
     A description of support provided by Channel Access for access security.</li>
  <li>Trapping Channel Access Puts<br />
     This allows trapping of put and process requests to a PVData database.</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirements for access security were generated at ANL/APS in 1992. The requirements document is:
<a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/EpicsDocumentation/EpicsGeneral/WorkInProgress/casecsp.html">Channel Access Security Requirements</a>


<hr />
<h2 style="text-align: center">Quick Start</h2>
<hr />
<p>TBD. This section will describe how to start access security for a javaIOC.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center">User's Guide</h2>

<h3>Feautures</h3>
<p>Access security protects IOC databases from unauthorized Channel Access Clients. Access security is based on the
following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Who<br />userid of the channel access client.</li>
  <li>Where<br />Hostid where the user is logged on. This is the host on which the channel access client exists. Thus no
  attempt is made to see if a user is local or is remotely logged on to the host.
  </li>
  <li>What<br />Individual fields of records are protected. Each record has a field containing the Access Security Group
  (ASG) to which the record belongs. Each field has an access security level, which must be 0 or 1.The security level
  is defined in the ascii record definition file. Thus the access security level for a field is the same for all record
  instances of a record type.
  </li>
  <li>When<br />Access rules can contain input links and calculations similar to the calculation record.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>Channel Access can be enhanced to implement authorization for CA udp and tcp access
to a PVData database but this is not the responsibility of access secuity.</p>
<p>An PVData database can be accessed only via Channel Access or via a shell.
It is assumed that access to the
shell is protected via physical security and standard networking and
physical security methods.
</p>
<p>No attempt has been made to protect against the sophisticated saboteur. Network security methods must be used to limit
access to the subnet on which the iocs reside.
</p>
<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>This document uses the following definitions:</p>
<ul>
   <li>ASL<br />Access Security Level (Called access level in Req Doc)</li>
   <li>ASG<br />Access Security Group (Called PV Group in Req Doc)</li>
   <li>UAG<br />User Access Group</li>
   <li>HAG<br />Host Access Group</li>
</ul>
<h3>Access Security Configuration File</h3>
<p>This section describes the format of a file containing definitions of the user access groups, host access groups, and access security groups.
Lets first give a simple example and then a complete description of the syntax.
