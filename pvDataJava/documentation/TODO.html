<h1>TODO</h1>
<h2>org.epics.pvdata.util.*</h2>
<p>Is this being used?
If being used this document should talk about it.
If not being used it should be deleted.</p>
<h2>postMonitor: PVUnion, PVUnionArray, and PVStructureArray</h2>
<p>PVUnion, PVUnionArray, and PVStructureArray all have elements
that are treated like a top level field.</p>
<p>Currently if a subField of any of these is changed postMonitor is not called for the field itself.</p>
<p>David asked if this could be changed so that it is called.
Marty thinks this may not be a good idea.</p>
<h2>timeStamp, display, control, and valueAlarm</h2>
<p>normativeTypes.html defines time_t,  display_t, control_t, and alarmlimit_t.
The definitions are not compatible with how property defined timeStamp, display, control, and valueAlarm.
The definition of alarm_t does match the definition of property alarm.</p>
<h2>convert</h2>
<p>The array conversion methods must implement stride so that the stride argument of ChannelArray
can be supported.</p>
<h2>monitorPlugin</h2>
<p>A debate is on-going about what semantics should be.</p>
<h2>PVAuxInfo</h2>
<p>This should go away.
This can not be done until pvIOCJava is changed.</p>
<h2>sharedData</h2>
<p>The share data methods for arrays should go away.
Copy On Write semantics for arrays should be implemented.</p>
